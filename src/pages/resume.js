            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I’m Jenine Gutierrez, a dedicated Diagnostic Medical Sonography student at the Canadian National Institute of Health (CNIH), on track to graduate in December 2025.

            From an early age, I was drawn to the healthcare field, inspired by the impact that compassionate, skilled professionals can have on people’s lives. My journey began with earning a Medical Office Assistant certificate in December 2022, equipping me with essential knowledge of medical office operations and patient care. Working as a Clerk at an ultrasound clinic, I became immersed in the world of diagnostic imaging, gaining hands-on experience with patient interactions, clinic workflows, and the vital role sonographers play in early detection and diagnosis.

            This experience solidified my passion for medical imaging and patient-centered care. Sonography is more than just a profession to me—it’s a way to combine my love for science, technology, and human connection. Every scan tells a story, and I am committed to ensuring that each patient feels seen, heard, and cared for during their healthcare journey.

            My sonography program consists of 12 months of theory and scan lab training, followed by an 8-month practicum rotation, where I will refine my technical skills and bedside manner in a clinical setting. I am in good standing with CNIH and a proud student member of Sonography Canada, ARDMS, and OARMS, staying engaged with the latest advancements in the field.

            With a strong foundation in both technical expertise and compassionate care, I am excited to contribute to the healthcare industry, helping to provide accurate diagnoses and make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.
