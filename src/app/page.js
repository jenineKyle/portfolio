              a dedicated Diagnostic Medical Sonography student at the Canadian National Institute of Health (CNIH), on track to graduate in December 2025.
              <br /><br />
              From an early age, I was drawn to the healthcare field, inspired by the impact that compassionate, skilled professionals can have on people’s lives. My journey began with earning a Medical Office Assistant certificate in December 2022, equipping me with essential knowledge of medical office operations and patient care. Working as a Clerk at an ultrasound clinic, I became immersed in the world of diagnostic imaging, gaining hands-on experience with patient interactions, clinic workflows, and the vital role sonographers play in early detection and diagnosis.
              <br /><br />
              This experience solidified my passion for medical imaging and patient-centered care. Sonography is more than just a profession to me—it’s a way to combine my love for science, technology, and human connection. Every scan tells a story, and I am committed to ensuring that each patient feels seen, heard, and cared for during their healthcare journey.
              <br /><br />
              My sonography program consists of 12 months of theory and scan lab training, followed by an 8-month practicum rotation, where I will refine my technical skills and bedside manner in a clinical setting. I am in good standing with CNIH and a proud student member of Sonography Canada, ARDMS, and OARMS, staying engaged with the latest advancements in the field.
              <br /><br />
              With a strong foundation in both technical expertise and compassionate care, I am excited to contribute to the healthcare industry, helping to provide accurate diagnoses and make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.
